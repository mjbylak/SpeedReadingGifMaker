## Overview
The SpeedReadingGifMaker is a Python application allowing users to input text, speed, and font size to generate a GIF, where each word appears one at a time. 
This tool is useful for creating visual aids for presentations, enhancing learning experiences, or simply having fun with text animations.

## Features
- **Text Input**: Users can enter any string of text they wish to animate.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed at which text changes in the GIF.
- **Customizable Font Size**: Adjust the font size (I've found 64 to be around the easiest to read without overflow).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pillow
- imageio
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Setup
To set up the Text to GIF Generator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-gif-generator.git
   cd text-to-gif-generator
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow imageio

### Usage
To run the application, execute the following command in the terminal:
  ```bash
  python main.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your text, set the frame duration (speed), and choose the font size.
\
Or simply download the EXE file from Releases (although program startup times seems to increase significantly).
